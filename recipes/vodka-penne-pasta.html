        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made with vodka and penne pasta, usually made with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions, and sometimes sausage, pancetta or peas.</p>
        <p>This vodka pasta is a nice change from your typical tomato sauce. If you're worried about the alcohol, don't be! It cooks off and cannot be tasted. It simply helps to enhance the flavors.</p>
