        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made with vodka and penne pasta, usually made with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions, and sometimes sausage, pancetta or peas.</p>
        <p>This vodka pasta is a nice change from your typical tomato sauce. If you're worried about the alcohol, don't be! It cooks off and cannot be tasted. It simply helps to enhance the flavors.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked penne pasta </li>
            <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>2 (3.5 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage </li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes </li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vodka </li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove casing from sausage and add to the skillet. Cook and stir until crumbly and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until garlic is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cream and vodka; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and add pasta; toss for 1 minute. Stir in parsley; serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
